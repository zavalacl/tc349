    <ol>2 cups chicken stock or broth</ol>
  </ol>


<h2>Directions</h2>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Cut off the root end of each pearl onion and make an "x" with your knife in its place.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil and drop in the onions for 1 minute.<br>Remove the onions from the pot, allow them to cool, and then peel.<br>You should be able to slide the onions right out of their skin. Set aside.</li></p>
    <li><p>Sprinkle the chicken on all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li></p>
    <li><p>Place the chicken pieces, a few at a time, into a large (1 or 2-gallon) sealable plastic bag<br>along with the flour. Shake to coat all of the pieces of the chicken. Remove the chicken<br>from the bag to a metal rack.</li></p>
    <li><p>Add the 2 tablespoons of water to a large, 12-inch saute pan over medium heat along with the salt pork.<br>Cover and cook until the water is gone, and then continue to cook until the salt pork cubes are golden brown and crispy, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.<br>Remove the salt pork from the pan and set aside.</li></p>
    <li><p>In the same pan, using the remaining fat, add the pearl onions, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and saute until lightly brown, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.<br>Remove the onions from the pan and set aside.</li></p>
    <li><p>Next, brown the chicken pieces on each side until golden brown, working in batches if necessary to not overcrowd the pan.</li></p>
    <li><p>Transfer the chicken into a 7 to 8-quart enameled cast iron Dutch oven.</li></p>
    <li><p>Add the mushrooms to the same 12-inch saute pan, adding the 1 tablespoon of butter if needed, and saute until they give up their liquid, approximately 5 minutes.</li></p>
    <li><p>Store the onions, mushrooms and pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li></p>
    <li><p>Pour off any remaining fat and deglaze the pan with approximately 1 cup of the wine.<br>Pour this into the Dutch oven along with the chicken stock, tomato paste, quartered onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf.<br>Add all of the remaining wine. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li></p>
    <li><p>The next day, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender.<br>Maintain a very gentle simmer and stir occasionally.</li></p>
    <li><p>Once the chicken is done, remove it to a heatproof container, cover, and place it in the oven to keep warm.<br>Strain the sauce in a colander and remove the carrots, onion, celery, thyme, garlic, and bay leaf.<br>Return the sauce to the pot, place over medium heat, and reduce by 1/3.<br>Depending on how much liquid you actually began with, this should take 20 to 45 minutes.</li></p>
    <li><p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the pearl onions, mushrooms, and pork and cook for another 15 minutes or until the heated through.<br>Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, remove from the heat, add the chicken and serve.<br>Serve over egg noodles, if desired.</li></p>
  </ol>
</div>

<p><strong>Cookâ€™s Note:</strong><i> If the sauce is not thick enough at the end of reducing, you may add a mixture of equal parts butter and flour<br>kneaded together. Start with 1 tablespoon of each. Whisk this into the sauce for 4 to 5 minutes and repeat, if necessary.</i></p>
